C:\R-xts> R CMD INSTALL --build xts --library="C:/R-xts/install" --no-multiarch --no-libs --no-test-load

This library builds WITHOUT DLLs (some errors happen when R tries to compile DLLs)

Copy libs/i836 and x64 from Vlad's computer into the installation directory, and you have good XTS

NB: if your Rtools are installed correctly, you should be able to build the DLLs as well with 
R CMD INSTALL --build xts --library="C:/R-xts/install"
